This is used to create some of the figures in RuleML2014 paper.

Figure 3 & Figure 6, these two are input visualizations, run:
./input.sh
Euler will create folders named by your host-username and date, go to the 0-input/ subfolder to see the figure.

Figure 7, this is the diagnostic lattice of example abstract3, run:
./lattich.sh abstract3.txt
Euler will create the diagnostic lattice in full/reduced version.
