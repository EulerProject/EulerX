This is used to test Euler runs in different stylesheets.

By default Euler will use the stylesheets in stylesheets/ folder, if Euler can not find any stylesheet in that folder (or the folder does not exist), Euler will use default stylesheets in source code.

Run euler with:
euler -i pw1.txt

e.g. try to copy and replace the "inputstyle.yaml" in stylesheets/ with the one outside. You can see the legend is off.
You can also change the styles of edges and nodes. Or remove the folder stylesheets/ to see how it works in default styles.
