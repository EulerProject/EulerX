# Thank you for using Euler

Here are examples under example/ directory, 

1. cd to example/ directory
2. run test.sh by "./test.sh", you will find the output files in output/test/
3. "./run.sh abstract", you will find the output files in output/abstract/
4. "./run.sh abstract2", you will find the output files in output/abstract2/
5. "./run.sh abstract3", you will find the output files in output/abstract3/
6. "./run.sh abstract3b", you will find the output files in output/abstract3b/, it is the "Bertram" mode for abstract3.
7. "./run.sh abstract2c", you will find the output files in output/abstract2c/, it is the test case with articulation confidence for abstract2.
