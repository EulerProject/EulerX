A RCC8 based qualitative spatial reasoner written in pure Python

PyRCC8 is an efficient qualitative spatial reasoner written in pure Python. It implements the RCC8 constraint language that has been popularly adopted by the Qualitative Spatial Reasoning and GIS communities.

PyRCC8 Manual
############################
1. Create the input file for PyRCC8
The input file is in file extension .csp, and by default put into ./csp folder

The format of input file: Take "wiki.csp" as an example

"wiki.csp"
4 #wiki_example
0 1 ( DC )
0 2 ( NTPP TPP )
0 3 ( DC EC )
0 4 ( EC )
1 2 ( DC EC )
1 3 ( NTPP )
1 4 ( EC )
2 3 ( DC EC )
.

All the concepts are denoted by integers (Starting from 0)

The first line shows the "last" concept (In this example, we have 5 concepts, which are 0,1,2,3,4; so the first line shows the "last concept" 4). "wiki_example" followed by a "#" is the comment of this example.

Starting from the second line, each line represents a pair of concepts (denoted by integers) and the RCC8 relations between them (listed in parentheses)
e.g the second line shows concept0 and concept1 are dis-connect; the fourth line shows concept0 and concept3 are either dis-connect or external connect

The input file is ended with a dot "."


2. Run PyRCC8 to check the consistency of the input relations (Refer to README file in package)
